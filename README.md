## Usage

Creates an AWS Athena workgroup that encrypts results server-side.

```hcl
module "athena_workgroup" {
  source = "dod-iac/athena-workgroup/aws"

  name = format("app-%s-%s", var.application, var.environment)
  output_location = format("s3://%s/", var.bucket_name)
  tags  = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

Creates an AWS Athena workgroup that encrypts results server-side using a KMS key.

```hcl
module "s3_kms_key" {
  source = "dod-iac/s3-kms-key/aws"

  name = format("alias/app-%s-s3-%s", var.application, var.environment)
  description = format("A KMS key used to encrypt objects at rest in S3 for %s:%s.", var.application, var.environment)
  principals = ["*"]
  tags = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}

module "athena_workgroup" {
  source = "dod-iac/athena-workgroup/aws"

  encryption_option = "SSE_KMS"
  kms_key_arn = module.s3_kms_key.aws_kms_key_arn
  name = format("app-%s-%s", var.application, var.environment)
  output_location = format("s3://%s/", var.bucket_name)
  tags  = {
    Application = var.application
    Environment = var.environment
    Automation  = "Terraform"
  }
}
```
